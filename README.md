### Project Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-laravel-project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**

    ```bash
    cd your-laravel-project
    ```

3. **Install Composer Dependencies**

    Laravel uses Composer to manage its dependencies. Run the following command to install all required packages:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. **Create a Copy of the Environment File**

    Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Update this file with your database connection information:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Open `.env` and set the following variables:

    - `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`
    - `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`
    - `DB_PORT=3306`
    - `DB_DATABASE=your_database_name`
    - `DB_USERNAME=your_database_username`
    - `DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password`

5. **Generate the Application Key**

    Run the following command to generate a unique application key:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. **Run Migrations**

    Execute database migrations to create the necessary database tables:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

7. **Start the Development Server**

    You can use the built-in Laravel development server to run your application:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    Your Laravel application should now be running locally. Access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

8. **Optional: Seed the Database (For Sample Data)**

    If you have seeders set up, you can populate the database with sample data:

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```
